# Agile Results

J.D. Meier has an amazing blog called Sources of Insight and he's written a fantastic book called Getting Results the Agile Way. You can buy his book on Amazon 


> The way it works is, on Mondays, you figure out the 3 outcomes you want for the week.  Each day you identify 3 outcomes you want to accomplish.  On Friday, you reflect on 3 things going well and 3 things to improve.  Itâ€™s that simple. - J.D. Meier

There will be a few tweaks to the methodology. For example, I may allow for:
1. Hours tracking -  how long an outcome is estimated to take.
2. Comment support - 1 comment per day)
3. Possibly expanding weekly goals from 3 to 5
4. Keeping daily outcomes at 3.

# Technology

This is my first experiment in working with ASP.NET MVC Core 1.0. I think of this mainly as a learning experiment.

My initial approach is to take advantage of the newer **tag helpers** in MVC Core 1.0 as much as possible but I could also see some advantages with using **templated razor controls** (which have been around since the pre-Core MVC days).
